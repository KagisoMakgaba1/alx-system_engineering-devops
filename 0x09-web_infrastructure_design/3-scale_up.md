# Scale up

## Description

This infrastructure design prioritizes scalability, high availability, performance, and security by separating components into distinct layers and leveraging technologies like HAProxy for load balancing and redundancy.

## Specifics of the Infrastructure

1. Server:
  - This will act as the primary server hosting the application components. It will need to have adequate resources to handle the expected load.

2. Load-Balancer (HAProxy):
  - HAProxy is being used as a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability.
  - By configuring HAProxy as a cluster, we ensure redundancy and failover capabilities. If one instance fails, the other can seamlessly take over, minimizing downtime.
  - Additionally, HAProxy provides features like SSL termination, health checks, and session persistence, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the infrastructure.

3. Web Server:
  - The web server handles incoming HTTP requests from clients and serves static content such as HTML, CSS, and client-side scripts.
  - By separating the web server from the application server, we can scale each layer independently based on their specific requirements. This separation also enhances security by isolating different components of the application.

4. Application Server:
  - The application server hosts the core logic and business functionality of the application. It processes dynamic requests, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic content.
  - Having a dedicated application server allows us to optimize performance by fine-tuning the server configuration and resource allocation specifically for application processing.

5. Database Server:
  - The database server stores and manages the application's data. It is crucial for maintaining data integrity, consistency, and reliability.
  - Separating the database server ensures that database operations do not compete with other components for resources, improving overall performance and scalability.
  - Additionally, having a dedicated database server enables us to implement advanced database features such as replication, clustering, and backup strategies to ensure data availability and disaster recovery.
